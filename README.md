# hello-lambda-node

Code based on AWS developer guide: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/typescript-image.html

## Local environment set up

- Create an account with Amazon Web Services

- Install local development tools:

  - Node.js
  - Docker
  - [AWS CLI (v2)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
  - Make

- Set up a minimally privileged account to use with the `aws` CLI. [See documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-authentication.html). Current best practice is to follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) creating an AWS organization, a minimally privileged account and logging into the account using `aws configure sso` which writes short-lived credentials to your development machine. To upload docker images to an AWS container registry and deploy a lambda service the following permissions are required:

  - `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess`
  - `AWSLambda_FullAccess`

- Authenticate the AWS CLI using `aws configure sso`.

- Authenticate the Docker CLI. Create a `.env` file based on `.env-example` and run `make docker-auth`.

## Building and deploying a Lambda image

- Add a docker image name to your `.env` file and create a docker image using by running `make docker-build`.

- Test that the image runs locally by running `make docker-run` and calling it with:

```bash
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations" -d '{}'
{"statusCode":200,"body":"{\"message\":\"hello world\"}"} | jq
```

- Create a repository for storing docker images by adding a repository name to `.env`, using `make aws-create-repository` and adding the resulting repository uri to `.env`.

- Upload your image to the repository by running `make docker-tag` and `make docker-push`.

- Create an execution role for the function using `make aws-create-role` adding the resulting Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to your `.env` file.

- Grant the execution role the ability to write logs by running `make aws-attach-log-policy`.

- Create the function by running `make aws-create-function`, saving the resulting function uri in `.env`.

- Test the function by running `make aws-invoke-function`.

- To redeploy the function with changes run `make docker-build-tag-push` and `make aws-update-function-code`. Note that updating the code happens asynchronously and it may take a nearly a minute for the changes to be visible.

## Attaching an endpoint for the Lambda

- Create an API Gateway for the Lambda by adding a gateway name to your `.env` file and running `make aws-create-api`. Save the resulting id in `.env` to configure the gateway.

- Create a "stage" for your API by running `make aws-create-stage`, this gives the API a public URL. There can be multiple stages for multiple deployment environments (dev, stg, prd) but we'll use "default" for a single stage.

- Create an "integration" for your API by running `make aws-create-integration` and wave the integration id in your `.env` file, this associates the API Gateway to a lambda function.

- Create a "route" for your API by running `make aws-create-route` this attaches an HTTP verb and path to the public URL.

- Run `make aws-lambda-add-permission` to give the new API Gateway permission to invoke the Lambda function and run `make aws-create-deployment` to deploy the API making it public.

- Test the public endpoint by inserting your API's ID and region then running:

  ```bash
  curl https://<AWS_GATEWAY_ID>.execute-api.<AWS_REGION>.amazonaws.com/default/hello-world | jq
  ```

  You should see the message:

  ```json
  {
    "message": "hello world ðŸŒŽ!"
  }
  ```
